Introduction to the Dataset
The datasets used in this project are related to Twitter sentiment analysis, comprising tweets categorized based on their sentiment. The datasets are provided in two CSV files: twitter_training.csv and twitter_validation.csv. Each dataset contains the following columns:

Column 0: ID
Column 1: Topic (e.g., Facebook, Amazon, etc.)
Column 2: Sentiment (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative, Irrelevant)
Column 3: Tweet text
Dataset Overview:

Training Dataset: twitter_training.csv
Number of Records: Varies
Columns: 4 (ID, Topic, Sentiment, Tweet text)
Validation Dataset: twitter_validation.csv
Number of Records: Varies
Columns: 4 (ID, Topic, Sentiment, Tweet text)
These datasets are essential for training and validating machine learning models aimed at predicting the sentiment of tweets based on their content.

Project Description
The main objective of this project is to develop and evaluate various machine learning models to predict the sentiment of tweets. The project includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Inspection:

Load the training and validation datasets from twitter_training.csv and twitter_validation.csv.
Inspect the first few records to understand the data structure.
Data Cleaning:

Remove duplicate entries and handle missing values.
Standardize the text data by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation.
Label Encoding:

Encode the sentiment labels into numerical values for model compatibility:
Positive: 2
Neutral: 1
Negative: 0
Irrelevant: 3
Data Splitting:

Split the cleaned data into features (tweets) and labels (sentiments) for both training and validation datasets.
Model Development and Evaluation:

Implement and evaluate various classification models, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Naive Bayes
Use a TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction from the tweet text.
Define pipelines for each model to streamline the training and evaluation process.
Model Evaluation:

Train each model on the training dataset and evaluate its accuracy on the validation dataset.
Generate classification reports to assess the performance of each model.
Plot confusion matrices to visualize the prediction results for each model.
This approach allows us to compare the performance of different models and identify the most effective one for sentiment prediction.
